First of all, thank you very much for this opportunity you gave me.

Searching for a product in the web application called "WebstaurantStore.com" in line with the test case sent to me, the relation of the listed products with the searched word, and adding one of the listed products to the cart and empty the cart was a test case.

-In My Project;

* I used Cucumber-TestNG-JUnit framework built by Maven,
* It is structured based on PAGE OBJECT MODEL and uses the SINGLETON
  webDriver,
* I wrote my codes with Java,
* I used Gherkin Language,
* I used Page Factory Design Pattern to instantiate the webElement using
  @FindBy annotation which makes it easier and convenient,
* I used utility package for Driver,ConfigReader and ReusablaMethods,
* I used configuration.properties for using test data's,
* I used html report that's located in target folder which is called cucumber-reports -"html:target/cucumber-report".
